# ⚙️ Machine Failure Prediction using Sensor Data 📊

This project leverages machine learning to predict machine failures based on sensor data, enabling proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime.  The goal is to identify patterns in sensor readings that indicate impending failures, allowing for timely interventions and preventing costly equipment breakdowns. 🛠️

## 📚 Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project contains sensor readings collected from various machines. It includes a variety of sensor measurements as well as a binary indicator of machine failure.  The dataset is provided as a CSV file.  You can upload the CSV file directly within the Colab notebook. 💾

### 📈 Columns Description

* **footfall:** The number of people or objects passing by the machine. 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️
* **temp Mode:** The temperature mode or setting of the machine. 🌡️
* **AQ:** Air quality index near the machine. 💨
* **USS:** Ultrasonic sensor data, indicating proximity measurements. 📡
* **CS:** Current sensor readings, indicating the electrical current usage of the machine. ⚡
* **VOC:** Volatile organic compounds level detected near the machine. 🧪
* **RP:** Rotational position or RPM (revolutions per minute) of the machine parts. ⚙️
* **IP:** Input pressure to the machine. 🗜️
* **Temperature:** The operating temperature of the machine. 🔥
* **fail:** Binary indicator of machine failure (1 for failure, 0 for no failure). ❌✅

## ⚙️ Project Methodology

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** The dataset is loaded using pandas, and basic information about the data is displayed, including the first few rows. 🔍

2. **Missing Value Handling:**  The code checks for missing values and imputes them using the median value of each column.  This ensures that the model can handle incomplete data. 🧹

3. **Feature and Target Separation:** The dataset is divided into features (sensor readings) and the target variable (machine failure indicator). ➗

4. **Train-Test Split:** The data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.  Stratified splitting is used to maintain the class balance between the training and testing sets. ✂️

5. **Feature Scaling:** The features are scaled using StandardScaler to standardize the range of values.  This is important for many machine learning algorithms, including RandomForest. ⚖️

6. **Model Training:** A RandomForestClassifier model is trained on the scaled training data.  The model is configured with 200 estimators (trees) and a maximum depth of 10. 🏋️

7. **Prediction:** The trained model is used to make predictions on the scaled test data. 🔮

8. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, classification report (precision, recall, F1-score), and a confusion matrix. ✅

9. **Visualization:** The confusion matrix and feature importances are visualized using matplotlib and seaborn.  The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions, while the feature importance plot shows which features have the greatest influence on the model's predictions. 📊📈

## 💻 Code Overview

The code is written in Python and utilizes the following libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn

The code is designed to be easily runnable in a Google Colab environment, with file upload functionality included. ☁️

## 🚀 Running the Code

1. Open the provided Colab notebook. 📓
2. Upload your CSV dataset to the Colab environment when prompted by the code.  The code uses the `files.upload()` function from the `google.colab` library to facilitate this. 📤
3. Run the Colab notebook cells sequentially. The code will guide you through the process, including uploading the data file. ▶️

## 📈 Results

The project outputs the model's accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and feature importance plot.  These results provide insights into the model's predictive capabilities and the factors that contribute to machine failures.  The accuracy score gives an overall measure of how well the model performs, while the classification report provides more detailed metrics about precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (failure/no failure). The confusion matrix visually represents the model's performance, showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.  The feature importance plot helps identify which sensor readings are most influential in predicting machine failures. 🧐

## 🔮 Future Work
